            <p class="main block">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son 
                and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond 
                the world of known physics.

            <p class="main block">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created 
                in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential 
                hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that 
                exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously 
                violent instant.</p>
                
            <p class="main block">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole 
                and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. 
                Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                
            <p class="main block">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
